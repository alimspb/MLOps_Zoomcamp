TLC Trip Record Data

Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing 
- pickup and drop-off dates/times
- pickup and drop-off locations
- trip distances
- itemized fares
- rate types
- payment types
- driver-reported passenger counts 

The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi 
and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab 
& Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). 

The trip data was not created by the TLC, 
and TLC makes no representations as to the accuracy of these data.

For-Hire Vehicle (“FHV”) trip records include fields capturing
the dispatching base license number and the pickup date, 
time, and taxi zone location ID (shape file below).

These records are generated from the FHV Trip Record submissions 
made by bases, so we cannot guarantee or confirm their accuracy or completeness. 
The TLC performs routine reviews of the records 
and takes enforcement actions when necessary to ensure, to the extent possible, 
complete and accurate information. 
Since 2019 high volume trip records (HVFHV) are reported in a separate (and more detailed) dataset.

For 2025 data onwards, a cbd_congestion_fee column has been added to the Yellow, 
Green, and High Volume FHV datasets to reflect new congestion pricing charges.
